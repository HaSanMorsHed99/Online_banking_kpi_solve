# solve some problem
#1. How many unique customers are there?
#2. How many unique customers are coming from each region?
#3. How many unique customers are coming from each area?
#4. What is the total amount for each transaction type?
#5. For each month - how many customers make more than 1 deposit and 1 withdrawal in a single month?
#6. What is closing balance for each customer?
#7. What is the closing balance for each customer at the end of the month?
#8. Please show the latest 5 days total withdraw amount.
#9. Find out the total deposit amount for every five days consecutive series. You can assume 1 week = 5 days.
#	Please show the result week wise total amount.
#10. Plase compare every weeks total deposit amount by the following previous wweek.
#
#	Example: Week 1 will be compared with Week 2 [Calculation Week2 - Week 1]-> Next week - previous week
#		Week 2 will be compared with Week 3  [Calculation Week3 - Week 2]
